## üîß **Key Fixes Implemented**

### 1. **ATN News - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Website doesn't show articles in regular HTML pages
**Solution**: Implemented sitemap-based scraping approach
- Uses daily sitemaps: `https://www.atnnewstv.com/sitemap/sitemap-daily-YYYY-MM-DD.xml`
- Extracts article URLs with `/details/` pattern
- Successfully scrapes and saves articles

**Key Implementation**:
```python
# Use sitemap approach for ATN News
for days_back in range(5):  # Try last 5 days
    date_str = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=days_back)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    sitemap_url = f"https://www.atnnewstv.com/sitemap/sitemap-daily-{date_str}.xml"
    # Parse XML and extract article URLs
```

### 2. **Enhanced All Regular Scrapers** ‚úÖ
- Updated CSS selectors based on current website structures
- Added fallback content extraction using paragraphs
- Improved URL filtering with regex patterns
- Better error handling and content validation

### 3. **Somoy News Investigation** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem**: Website has strong anti-bot protection (403 Forbidden)
**Attempted Solutions**:
- Multiple user agents (desktop, mobile, different browsers)
- Extended delays and retry logic
- Alternative URLs (mobile, RSS, sitemap)
- Different request headers and approaches

**Recommendation**: Somoy News requires advanced techniques:
1. **Selenium/Browser Automation** - Render JavaScript and bypass bot detection
2. **Proxy Rotation** - Use different IP addresses
3. **API Discovery** - Find if they have a public API or RSS feed
4. **Manual Investigation** - Check if they have alternative access methods
