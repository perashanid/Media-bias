# Media Bias Detector - Final Integration Summary

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. **Scraper Not Saving Articles** - FIXED
- **Problem**: Articles were being scraped but not stored in the database
- **Root Cause**: MongoDB text index was causing "language override unsupported" errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed problematic text indexes from MongoDB
  - Updated database initialization to handle existing indexes gracefully
  - Implemented proper error handling for index creation
  - Fixed language field compatibility issues

### 2. **No Home Page** - FIXED
- **Problem**: Dashboard was acting as both home page and dashboard
- **Solution**:
  - Created separate `Home.tsx` component with welcome content and feature explanations
  - Updated `Dashboard.tsx` to focus on statistics and data visualization
  - Updated routing in `App.tsx` to have separate `/` (home) and `/dashboard` routes
  - Updated navbar to include both Home and Dashboard links

### 3. **Missing Scraper API Routes** - FIXED
- **Problem**: Scraper endpoints were mixed in main app.py file
- **Solution**:
  - Created dedicated `api/routes/scraper.py` with proper blueprint structure
  - Added comprehensive scraper endpoints:
    - `/api/scrape/sources` - Get available sources
    - `/api/scrape/manual` - Manual scraping by URL or source
    - `/api/scrape/test-url` - Test URL scraping without storing
    - `/api/scrape/batch` - Batch scrape from all sources
  - Updated main app.py to use the scraper blueprint

### 4. **Frontend Integration Issues** - FIXED
- **Problem**: Frontend expected separate home and dashboard but they were combined
- **Solution**:
  - Updated ManualScraper component to handle batch scraping
  - Added proper result display for different scraping operations
  - Updated API service to include all scraper endpoints
  - Fixed navigation and routing issues

### 5. **Database Language Compatibility** - FIXED
- **Problem**: MongoDB rejecting "bengali" language field due to text index constraints
- **Solution**:
  - Removed text indexes that were causing language override errors
  - Updated search functionality to use regex instead of text search
  - Normalized language handling across all services
  - Added proper error handling for database operations

### 6. **BiasScore Model Inconsistencies** - FIXED
- **Problem**: Test code using wrong attribute names for BiasScore model
- **Solution**:
  - Updated test code to use correct attribute names:
    - `political_bias_score` instead of `political_bias`
    - `emotional_language_score` instead of `emotional_language`
    - `factual_vs_opinion_score` instead of `factual_vs_opinion`

## System Architecture Overview

### Backend Components
1. **Scraper Manager** - Coordinates scraping from multiple news sources
2. **Article Storage Service** - Handles database operations for articles
3. **Bias Analyzer** - Performs AI-powered bias analysis
4. **Scraping Orchestrator** - Manages automated scraping workflows
5. **API Routes** - RESTful endpoints for frontend communication

### Frontend Components
1. **Home Page** - Welcome page with feature explanations
2. **Dashboard** - Statistics and data visualization
3. **Manual Scraper** - Interface for manual scraping operations
4. **Article Browser** - Browse and search articles
5. **Bias Analyzer** - Analyze custom text for bias
6. **Comparison View** - Compare articles across sources

### Database Schema
- **Articles Collection**: Stores scraped articles with metadata
- **Indexes**: Optimized for URL, content hash, source, and date queries
- **Language Support**: Bengali and English content

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features
1. **Article Scraping**: Successfully scrapes from 5 Bangladeshi news sources
2. **Article Storage**: Stores articles in MongoDB with deduplication
3. **Bias Analysis**: AI-powered analysis of political bias, sentiment, and factual content
4. **API Endpoints**: Complete RESTful API for all operations
5. **Frontend Interface**: React-based web interface with Material-UI
6. **Database Operations**: Full CRUD operations with proper indexing
7. **Language Detection**: Automatic Bengali/English language detection
8. **Orchestrated Workflows**: Automated scraping and analysis pipelines

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
1. **Date Parsing**: Some date formats from news sources cause warnings (non-critical)
2. **Content Extraction**: Some news sites have anti-scraping measures
3. **Text Search**: Using regex search instead of full-text search (performance impact on large datasets)
