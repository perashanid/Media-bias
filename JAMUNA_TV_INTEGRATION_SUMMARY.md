# Jamuna TV Scraper Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Jamuna TV (https://jamuna.tv) as a new news source in the Media Bias Detector application. The scraper is fully functional and integrated into the existing system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Scraper Development
- **File**: `scrapers/jamuna_tv_scraper.py`
- **Class**: `JamunaTVScraper`
- **Base Class**: `EnhancedScraper` (supports comprehensive crawling)
- **Language Support**: Primarily Bengali with English content detection

### 2. Key Features
- **Comprehensive Crawling**: Uses enhanced scraping to crawl the entire website
- **Intelligent Article Detection**: Identifies article pages vs. category/navigation pages
- **Multi-language Support**: Detects Bengali and English content
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handles 404 errors and network issues gracefully
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements delays to avoid overwhelming the server

### 3. Technical Approach
Since Jamuna TV's section URLs (like `/news`, `/politics`) return 404 errors, the scraper uses:
- **Homepage Crawling**: Starts from the main site and follows all valid links
- **Link Filtering**: Intelligently filters out unwanted URLs (ads, navigation, etc.)
- **Article Identification**: Uses multiple indicators to identify article pages:
  - Presence of article content elements
  - URL patterns
  - Content length and structure
  - HTML5 semantic elements

### 4. Integration Points

#### Scraper Manager
- Added to `scrapers/scraper_manager.py`
- Available as both regular and enhanced scraper
- Supports comprehensive crawling with configurable depth and article limits
