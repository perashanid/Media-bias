# Scraper Fixes Summary

## üéâ Successfully Fixed Scrapers

### 1. Daily Star Regular Scraper ‚úÖ
**Issues Fixed:**

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Better URL filtering
has_article_id = re.search(r'-\d{7}$', url) or '/news/' in url

# Improved content extraction with fallback
if len(content) < 100:
    paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
    content_parts = []
    for p in paragraphs:
        p_text = self._clean_text(p.get_text())
        if len(p_text) > 20:
            content_parts.append(p_text)
    content = ' '.join(content_parts)
```

**Result:** Now successfully scrapes and saves articles to database

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Focus on current articles
'a[href*="/2025/"]',  # Current year articles
'a[href*="/2024/"]',  # Recent articles

# Better article ID detection
has_article_id = re.search(r'/\d{7}$', url) or re.search(r'/\d{6}$', url)
```

- Added proper content extraction using `.content` selector (found in debug)
- Improved article ID pattern matching

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Handle special relative URL format
if href.startswith('//ekattor.tv/'):
    full_url = f"https:{href}"

# Use correct content selector found in debug
'.content',  # Found in debug - main content selector
```

**Result:** Now successfully scrapes and saves articles to database

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issue

### ATN News Scraper ‚ùå
**Problem Identified:**
- Website appears to use JavaScript-based content loading
- Category pages load but don't contain article links in static HTML
- Articles may be loaded dynamically via AJAX calls
- Traditional scraping approach may not work

**Investigation Results:**
- Homepage loads successfully
- Category pages return 200 status but contain no article links
- Only navigation and static content visible in HTML
- May require browser automation (Selenium) or API discovery

**Recommendations:**
1. **Option 1:** Implement Selenium-based scraper for JavaScript rendering
2. **Option 2:** Investigate if ATN News has an API or RSS feed
3. **Option 3:** Consider removing ATN News from active scrapers if not critical
