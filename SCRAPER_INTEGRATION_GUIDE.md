## Usage Examples

### 1. Check Scraper Health
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/scrape/health
```

### 2. Scrape from Single Source
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/scrape/manual \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": "atn_news",
    "max_articles": 5,
    "analyze_bias": true
  }'
```

### 3. Batch Scrape All Sources
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/scrape/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "max_articles_per_source": 10,
    "analyze_bias": true
  }'
```

### 4. Validate Source
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/scrape/validate-source \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "atn_news"}'
```

### 5. Get Scraping Statistics
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/scrape/statistics
```

## Frontend Integration

The enhanced scraper system integrates seamlessly with the React frontend through the ManualScraper component. Key features:

- Real-time scraping progress
- Health status indicators
- Error handling and user feedback
- Source validation
- Performance metrics display

## Monitoring and Health Checks

### Health Status Indicators
- ✅ **Healthy**: Scraper is working normally
- ⚠️ **Warning**: Some errors but still functional
- ❌ **Unhealthy**: Multiple failures, needs attention

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: Average time to scrape articles
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful scrapes
- **Total Articles**: Cumulative articles scraped
- **Error Count**: Number of failures

### Automatic Recovery
- Scrapers marked as unhealthy are automatically retested
- Health status resets after successful operations
- Failed scrapers don't block other sources

## Error Handling

### Network Errors
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Timeout handling
- Rate limiting compliance

### Parsing Errors
- Fallback content extraction methods
- Generic article structure detection
- Graceful degradation

### Storage Errors
- Duplicate detection and handling
- Database connection recovery
- Transaction rollback on failures

## Performance Optimizations

### Concurrent Processing
- Multi-threaded scraping with configurable worker limits
- Resource pooling and connection reuse
- Memory-efficient article processing

### Rate Limiting
- Respectful scraping with delays between requests
- Random user agent rotation
- Request header optimization

### Caching and Deduplication
- Content hash-based duplicate detection
- URL-based duplicate prevention
- Efficient database indexing

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# Scraping
SCRAPER_MAX_WORKERS=3
SCRAPER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=45
SCRAPER_MAX_RETRIES=3
SCRAPER_BASE_DELAY=2.0

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Scraper Settings
Each scraper can be configured individually:
- `max_retries`: Number of retry attempts
- `base_delay`: Base delay between requests
- `max_delay`: Maximum delay for exponential backoff
- `timeout`: Request timeout in seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Articles Found**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Validate source URL accessibility
   - Reset scraper health status

2. **High Error Rate**
   - Check for website structure changes
   - Verify rate limiting compliance
   - Review scraper logs for specific errors

3. **Slow Performance**
   - Adjust worker count
   - Check network latency
   - Monitor database performance

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test single scraper
python test_enhanced_integration.py

# Check scraper health
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/scrape/health

# Reset unhealthy scrapers
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/scrape/health/reset
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always check scraper health before batch operations
2. Use appropriate article limits to avoid overwhelming sources
3. Monitor error rates and adjust retry logic as needed
4. Implement proper error handling in frontend components

### For Operations
1. Monitor scraper health regularly
2. Set up alerts for high error rates
3. Perform periodic validation of all sources
4. Keep logs for troubleshooting

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Real-time scraping dashboard
- Automated source discovery
- Machine learning-based content extraction
- Advanced duplicate detection
- Scraping schedule management

### Scalability Improvements
- Distributed scraping across multiple servers
- Queue-based processing
- Advanced caching strategies
- Load balancing for high-traffic sources

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the scraper health status
2. Review application logs
3. Use the validation endpoint to test specific sources
4. Reset scraper health if needed

The enhanced scraper integration provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for news article collection with comprehensive monitoring and error handling capabilities.
