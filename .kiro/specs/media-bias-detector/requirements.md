# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a media bias detection system that analyzes news articles from major Bangladeshi news outlets. The system will scrape articles from specified news websites, analyze their content for bias indicators, and provide bias assessment reports. The goal is to help users understand potential bias in news reporting across different media sources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to scrape news articles from multiple Bangladeshi news websites, so that I can collect a comprehensive dataset for bias analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured with news source URLs THEN it SHALL successfully scrape articles from Prothom Alo (https://www.prothomalo.com/)
2. WHEN the system is configured with news source URLs THEN it SHALL successfully scrape articles from The Daily Star (https://www.thedailystar.net/)
3. WHEN the system is configured with news source URLs THEN it SHALL successfully scrape articles from BD Pratidin (https://www.bd-pratidin.com/)
4. WHEN the system is configured with news source URLs THEN it SHALL successfully scrape articles from Ekattor TV (https://ekattor.tv/)
5. WHEN the system is configured with news source URLs THEN it SHALL successfully scrape articles from ATN News TV (https://www.atnnewstv.com/)
6. WHEN scraping articles THEN the system SHALL extract article title, content, publication date, author, and source URL
7. WHEN encountering rate limiting or blocking THEN the system SHALL implement respectful delays and retry mechanisms
8. WHEN scraping fails for a source THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other sources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to store scraped articles in a structured format, so that I can efficiently process and analyze the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN articles are scraped THEN the system SHALL store them in a database with proper indexing
2. WHEN storing articles THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate articles based on URL and content hash
3. WHEN storing articles THEN the system SHALL maintain metadata including scrape timestamp and source information
4. WHEN the database reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL implement data retention policies
5. IF an article already exists THEN the system SHALL update the existing record rather than create duplicates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to analyze articles for bias indicators, so that I can understand potential bias in news reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing an article THEN the system SHALL detect sentiment bias (positive, negative, neutral)
2. WHEN analyzing an article THEN the system SHALL identify political bias indicators based on language patterns
3. WHEN analyzing an article THEN the system SHALL detect emotional language and loaded terms
4. WHEN analyzing an article THEN the system SHALL identify factual vs. opinion content
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL assign bias scores on defined scales
6. IF the article is in Bengali THEN the system SHALL handle Bengali language processing appropriately
7. IF the article is in English THEN the system SHALL handle English language processing appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view bias analysis results through a web interface, so that I can easily understand and compare bias across different sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with bias statistics by source
2. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL show individual article bias scores and explanations
3. WHEN comparing sources THEN the system SHALL provide comparative bias analysis across news outlets
4. WHEN filtering results THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range, source, and bias type
5. WHEN viewing an article THEN the system SHALL highlight specific bias indicators in the text
6. IF no data is available THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messages to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to compare how different news portals report the same story, so that I can quantify bias differences with percentage metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the same news story is covered by multiple sources THEN the system SHALL identify and group related articles
2. WHEN comparing related articles THEN the system SHALL calculate percentage differences in bias scores between sources
3. WHEN displaying comparisons THEN the system SHALL show which portal leans more toward which side with specific percentages
4. WHEN analyzing story coverage THEN the system SHALL identify which aspects each source emphasizes or omits
5. WHEN presenting comparison results THEN the system SHALL provide visual representations of bias percentage differences
6. IF articles cover similar topics THEN the system SHALL use content similarity algorithms to group them appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure and monitor the scraping process, so that I can ensure reliable data collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to set scraping schedules and intervals
2. WHEN monitoring scraping THEN the system SHALL provide logs and status reports
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications to administrators
4. WHEN updating scraper configurations THEN the system SHALL validate new settings before applying
5. IF a news source changes its structure THEN the system SHALL detect and alert about scraping failures
